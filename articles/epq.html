              This essay goes into depth about the historical and modern legislatorial context of the Computer Misuse Act of 1990; it discusses the utility of the act in legislating cybercrime historically and evaluates if it is fit for purpose today. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The eternal problem with the legislation of cybercrime</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The writing of laws surrounding cybercrime is inherently difficult. According to Moore's law, technology doubles in performance or halves in size every 2 years; and whilst this is widely considered to be slightly out-of-date at this point, the concept it raises of a constantly changing cyberspace, and an ever-changing threat for those in the cyber security field is still very valid. This, of course, means that it has been historically very difficult to legislate for crimes related to the misuse of computer material. 
              <br><br>
              Moore's Law, (Mollick -updated 2008), states that the speed of computers will double every two years, in accordance with the number of transistors which can be placed on a single computer chip. Back when Mollick's 2006 article was published, this law was an 'industry benchmark' and 'self-fulfilling prophecy' for the trajectory of technological advancement. Nowadays, the law is said to be having its relevance thrown into question, by MiQ and others, however, its guideline has helped to stimulate innovation for years. 
              <br><br>
              The story of Moore's law is an interesting one, and relevant to the discussion of the Computer Misuse Act of 1990. Relevant not only because it highlights the ever-changing and developing nature of digital technology landscape which has made it difficult for UK and worldwide legislation to tackle or define crimes surrounding the misuse of computers; but also as its redundancy parallels the hypocritical nature of the fall of the Computer Misuse Act in that technology and the modern day have caught up with them despite their inceptions being due to a need to keep up with, and define this swift march forward. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Definition of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The Computer Misuse Act of 1990 was enacted on 29th June 1990 and it defines Computer Misuse Offences as (1) Unauthorised access to computer material, (2) Unauthorised access with the intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences and (3) Unauthorised modification of computer material; according to the government legislation website, legislation.gov.uk. 
              <br><br>
              This definition of the act was very broad, and problems arose with attempting to determine the meanings of “authorised” and “unauthorised” activity and convictions had to prove that the offender was aware that they did not have authorised access to the information or system that they got into (Sachowski 2016). The content of an Acceptable Use Policy must include descriptions of what constitutes authorised or unauthorised activity in order to be more likely to be able to convict under the act. 
              <br><br>
              An Acceptable Use policy (AUP) document, according to TermsFeed, generally has a more narrow focus than a Terms and Conditions agreement. These documents become relevant in cases involving the Computer Misuse Act as it needs to be proven that the defendant didn't have authorised access to the system. 
              <br><br>
              The current iteration of the Act was written on the third of May, 2015, however, according to ITPro, the act is still out of date despite its changes and new legislation entirely is required in order to properly prosecute computer misuse offences. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h1>History of the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 </h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Case Study: Regina v Gold and Schifreen [1978]  </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The Computer Misuse Act was first passed due to a gap in the law that was highlighted by one of the first instances of a Computer Misuse crime which was unable to be properly prosecuted. The lack of necessary legislation meant that the pair of defendants had to be charged under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act of 1981, according to lawteacher.net, however, they could not be charged with the crime as the misuse of recorded data on a computer did not qualify in the case and under the act as a 'false instrument.' 
              <br><br>
              Whilst it was clear that computer hacking and misuse should be against the law, this lack of legislation highlighted that an act was urgently required to legislate the unauthorised access or modification of computer material. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The offence  </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The 1978 case of Regina v Gold and Schifreen, according to Swarb, involved British Telecom's Prestel service being hacked via a shoulder surfing social engineering technique at a trade show; where the defendants (Robert Schifreen and Stephen Gold) were able to obtain the relevant Username and Password ID to gain access to the system by witnessing a legitimate user entering their login credentials. 
              <br><br>
              The offence drew attention to the alarming fact that British Telecom did not take their security measures very seriously, with the engineer's username and password information being 2222222222 and 1234 respectively, as according to Shuttleworth (Principal lecturer at Coventry university), as well as the need for new legislation. 
              <br><br>
              As part of their ploy to expose this lack of security the pair located the Duke of Edinburgh's email address thereby demonstrating how much information and power they had access to, as stated by ITPro. The suspicious activity was monitored by BT and passed on to authorities. 
              <br><br>
              The misuse of the Prestel system caught the attention of UK intelligence organisations GCHQ and MI6, because the Prestel Computer Network was intended to act as the back-up computer system for the UK military if theirs went down during a time of war, therefore this breach was investigated by them in the interests of national security. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The proceedings</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              After some months of deliberation, and as already stated, the defendants were charged using the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act of 1981, with defrauding BT through the manufacturing of a “false instrument.” According to the IT Law Wiki, they were convicted on specimen charges; five against Shifreen with a fine of £750 and four against Gold with a fine of £600. 
              <br><br>
              Specimen charges, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, are employed when a defendant is being charged with multiple violations of the same offence in order to simplify the charging of that person without having to be charged with each individual offence. 
              <br><br>
              Despite the modest nature of the fines, the two journalists appealed to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal, according to the IT Law Wiki, with their defence lawyers citing the lack of evidence for “intent to obtain material gain.” They also argued exactly what lawyers would be puzzling over for the near future about the prosecution of Computer Misuse offences, that the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act was misapplied and no legislation covered these new offences. This meant that in effect they were not actually criminal offences. 
              <br><br>
              Their case was acquitted by Lord Justice Lane, which led to an appeal to the House of Lords in 1988 where the acquittal was upheld. Lord Justice Brandon made a statement of opinion on the conclusion of the Lords. In this conclusion he makes reference to the myth of Procrustes, who would stretch victims on a bed which wasn't correctly fitted. He also upholds that under the legislation at the time, “That is not a criminal offence”, and that “If it is thought desirable to make it so, that is a matter for the legislature rather than the courts.” 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>A matter for the legislature</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              In order to be passed into UK law, an Act of Parliament needs to be proposed as a Bill that must then be approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords as well as be given Royal Assent by the monarch, as according to legislation.gov.uk. All future changes to this type of legislation, which includes the Computer Misuse Act of 1990, need to be made in the form of another Act of Parliament. These acts of Parliament make up the Statute Law in the UK. 
              <br><br>
              The Computer Misuse Act was passed based on recommendations made by the English Law Commission after the Gold and Schifreen case; it was a private member's bill introduced by the Conservative MP Micheal Colvin. 
              <br><br>
              In his speech on the Computer Misuse Bill on 9th February 1990 to the House of Commons, Mr Micheal Colvin (MP for Romsey and Waterside at the time), the Member describes the problems faced by the United Kingdom related to Computer Misuse Offences. He also criticises the criminal cyber world which he is targeting with the act, quoting him from the API Parliament archive of the day's proceedings; 'The sort of twisted culture that the Bill is trying to stamp out.” 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Analysis of the long title</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The Computer Misuse Act of 1990's full title, as it was put forward as an Act of Parliament after the 1988 R v Gold and Schifreen case, was 'An Act to make provision for securing computer material against unauthorised access or modification; and for connected purposes.' 
              <br><br>
              This long form title is interesting, as it affords us an insight into the purpose of the legislation itself, and therefore can be used to further examine if the act has met or is currently meeting its own criteria set when it was first enacted. The title claims that the Computer Misuse Act should facilitate the prosecution of cases where the action of 'unauthorised access or modification' of 'computer material' has taken place, and to criminalise said action. 
              <br><br>
              A study of cases prosecuted using the act since this initial definition will show that the Computer Misuse Act 1990 is hypocritical from this design motivation and that it is unfit to prosecute these crimes; therefore being unable to 'secure computer material.'  
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Case Study: Regina v Bow Street Magistrates Court and Allison (A.P.) [1999] </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The Computer Misuse Act's unreliability and confusing phrasing has meant that cases tried under it have been put to scrutiny by the House of Lords on more than one occasion. I will now set out an example of the House of Lords convening to repeal a decision made under the Act which was described as 'erroneous' by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, as according to the publication of the Judgement (sourced on parliament.uk) and of the speech for the appeal by the Lord. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The offence and prior proceedings </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The criminal act started with interference from Joan Ojomo, according to the facts given in the speech in the House of Lords, as she was an employee of American Express as part of their credit department who would analyse customer accounts. She was only authorised to access the customer accounts which had been assigned to her for analysis, however, the system which American Express used at their offices meant that it was possible for her to access any account. 
              <br><br>
              Ms Ojomo did in fact access various other accounts and files, which she was not authorised to work on, and passed on this confidential information that she gained through unauthorised access to Mr Allison. This information given to him was then used to fraudulently obtain large sums of money from other user's accounts using automatic teller machines (or ATMs). 
              <br><br>
              The evidence against Joan Ojomo showed that she never had the authority or any sort of blanket authorisation to be accessing the data for the purposes she was using them for. All of the access was considered a breach of company policy and ethics- meaning that the company would have also considered her actions as unauthorised access. This definition of what constitutes unauthorised access becomes very important in cases that involve the Computer Misuse Act due to its requirements. 
              <br><br>
              According to American Express company records, Joan Ojomo accessed 189 accounts which she was not assigned to work on and therefore had no authorised access permission to look at. She and her conspirators, including Mr Allison, defrauded American Express and its customers of approximately US$1,000,000 through this computer misuse. When Mr Allison was arrested, he was found with forged American Express Cards and was earlier photographed during an information gathering operation using one of said cards to fraudulently obtain money from an ATM in London. 
              <br><br>
              This therefore meant that Mr Allison was being charged with a conspiracy with Ojomo to use the unauthorised access to be able to commit further offences including the forging of cards and theft from the company. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Lord Hobhouse's judgement in the House of Lords  </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              When it came to the crimes committed in this case under the Computer Misuse Act of 1990, Lord Hobhouse ruled that the conduct of Joan Ojomo came under Section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act which states that it is a crime to intentionally cause a computer to give access to data which the user is not authorised to have access to. However, as the House of Lords made clear and the crown prosecution service echo, an employee can only be found guilty of an offence if the employer had defined clear access rights and permissions that the employee intentionally ignored. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Sidebar- Case Study: DPP v Bignell [1998]   </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              As pointed out by the Crown prosecution service, you can contrast the case of R v Bow Street Magistrates Court and Allison with the case of D.P.P v Bignell. This is because, in this case, the bar for unauthorised access was not met under the confused description of the Computer Misuse Act. 
              <br><br>
              The Director of Public Prosecutions (or DPP), according to Oxford Reference, is responsible for the conduct of all criminal proceedings and prosecutions which are first instituted by the police. The DPP has authority to intervene in any criminal proceedings through the Crown Prosecution Service when there is confusion in the application of the law. 
              <br><br>
              The DPP's involvement with the Computer Misuse Act on multiple occasions shows its vague nature and how it repeatedly falls short to be fit to prosecute cybercrime. We shall see how the DPP will prosecute another case, later in this essay. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The offence</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              Two police officers, described by the case and also by Lord Hobhouse, asked and had an operator for the Police National Computer Information database collect for them the information about the registration of two cars. They made this request for their own personal purposes and not under the permitted authority for police purposes. This meant that they misrepresented the situation to the operator in order to obtain this information. 
              <br><br>
              Therefore, to blur the lines of how to prosecute this case even further, the computer operator thought that the use of the computer system to retrieve the data was authorised and was acting under correct authorisation from the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. 
              <br><br>
              This all meant that no offence had been committed according to the conclusion of the Divisional court; the defendants were merely requesting data, and the access of the computer user was authorised. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The issues with prosecution</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              Lord Hobhouse went on to confirm the conclusion of the Divisional Court in the earlier case within the Allison case. He stated that “it was a possible view of the facts that the role of the officers in Bignell had merely been to request another to obtain information by using the computer. The computer operator did not exceed his authority. His authority permitted him to access the data on the computer for the purpose of responding to requests made to him in proper form by police officers. No offence had been committed under section 1 of the CMA." 
              <br><br>
              Both judicial officials agreed that consideration of the case should have been looked at under the Data Protection Act of 1984 instead. This shows an inherent failing within the Computer Misuse Act to be able to properly handle Computer Misuse offences unless the agreement for authorised access is properly explained and formalised within an agreement between company and employee and is clearly broken. All of this inevitably leads to ineffective use of the act for prosecuting cybercrime. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h1>Historic Changes to the Act</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>The first DoS attack and 'Mafiaboy' [2000] </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              A Denial of Service (or DoS) attack is, as according to Britannica, a type of cybercrime and logically a misuse of a computer system in which an Internet site or service is made unavailable through the use of multiple computers or machines to repeatedly make requests that overwhelm the web service thereby preventing legitimate users from making legitimate requests. 
              <br><br>
              Denial of service is a relatively recent development in the “booming age” of the internet, with the first ever Denial of Service Attack causing disruption in both the tech field and in the prosecution and enforcement of the law. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The offence</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The 15-year old, who couldn't be identified under Canadian Law at the time (but has subsequently been revealed to be Micheal Calce), targeted and crippled the CNN website and 1,200 related sites in a Cyber attack, as first reported by the Guardian. However, as Britannica goes on to say, the Montreal hacker then proceeded to target several e-commerce sites including eBay and Amazon. 
              <br><br>
              Again from Britannica's figures and the estimation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the affected sites suffered US$1.7 Billion in damages as the internet had become essential to the workings of many governments and economies by the year 2000. 
              <br><br>
              As Mr Calce said in an interview 15 years later with NPR, "The New York Stock Exchange, they were freaking out”, “ 'OK — a 15-year-old kid can shut us down at any point? Is our money really safe?' " 
              <br><br>
              The ability for any 'black-hat' hacker anywhere in the world to access and manipulate multiple machines over a botnet system or through the hijacking of machines to conduct one of these crippling attacks shocked the financial world at the time. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The media coverage </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              Michael Calce, whilst on a media circuit in 2015 in an interview with the Financial Post, explained that he has now used his hacking experience to become a 'white-hat' hacker who audits different businesses and then advises them on how to avoid becoming victims of a 'black-hat' hacker like he once was when his first Denial of Service attack was performed. 
              <br><br>
              As according to Quofaro's Online Session 6.3- Concepts of Vulnerability and Pen Testing, a 'black-hat' hacker is one who illegally bypasses security systems to cause malicious damage to that system or for their own gain; whilst a 'white-hat' hacker is an ethical hacker who is an expert in computer security and specialises in penetration testing for companies and businesses.

              Rick Broadhead, an internet consultant talking to the Guardian at the time of the incident said, "We shouldn't feel any more safe because of this arrest; it is a new form of terrorism called Cyber terrorism. I really believe it won't go away."

            <h3>Case Study: DPP v Lennon [2006] </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The first UK case to deal with 'Denial of Service' (DoS) attacks was DPP v Lennon in 2006. The broad terms of the definitions in the Computer Misuse Act meant that this case was difficult to prosecute and was therefore another deferred to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The offence </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The defendant (a 16-year old teenager) was charged with the alleged use of a 'mail bombing' software named Avalanche v3.6 downloaded from the internet, according to the account by Pinset Masons Solicitors. The target was his former employer Domestic and General Group PLC for whom he was employed for three months until he was dismissed in December 2003; all according to the Computer Law and Security Review, Volume 22. 
              <br><br>
              The mail bombing software sent Domestic and General over 500,000 unsolicited e-mails, many of which being disguised so that they looked like they had come from the company's Human Resources manager. This constituted a form of 'Denial of Service' attack as the large volume of the email that was sent overwhelmed the target's email processing and server storage capacity. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The judgement</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              Lennon was charged under Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act, which makes it an offence to commit the “unauthorised modification” of a computer. However, it was difficult for the prosecution to claim that the modification of the email server through the sending of data, in the form of emails, was 'unauthorised'. The defence claimed that, because the purpose of an email server is to receive email, this was an authorised use of the company's system as the crime was defined under the Computer Misuse Act. 
              <br><br>
              District Judge Grant, who was presiding over the case, dismissed the charges against Lennon on the grounds that Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act was created to deal with and prosecute the use of malicious software like viruses, worms and Trojans which modify the data of the system, but not the new type of attack seen in this case. 
              <br><br>
              The judgement here aroused consideration which led to calls for the Computer Misuse Act to be updated in order to deal with this drastic change in technology which had shocked the world a full six years prior. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>The changes made by the Police and Justice Act [2006] </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The Police and Justice Act of 2006 amended section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act after the Case of DPP v Lennon. This amendment, as according to Pinsent Masons, provided more clarity and said that DoS attacks do constitute a criminal offence. The maximum years imprisonment for the offence was noteworthy as it was 10 years, a full 5 years higher than the maximum sentence of 5 years under the original Computer Misuse Act. 
              <br><br>
              Another change made by the Police and Justice Act to the Computer Misuse Act was the introduction of a corollary offence which made the supply of articles for use in computer misuse offences illegal. 
              <br><br>
              A corollary offence, as stated by Law insider, is an offence that leads on from the committing of a preliminary offence. This meant that the suppliers of the Avalanche mail-bombing software in this case, and of DoS software could be prosecuted.

            <h1>Utilisation of the Computer Misuse Act in the Modern day  </h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Latest update of the Act from 1990 [2015]   </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              On the third of May 2015, the latest version of the Computer Misuse act came into effect with changes to the legislation being brought forward by the amendments brought forward by the Serious Crime Act of 2015. These amendments modified the 1990 Act, which meant: the creation of a new offence of unauthorised acts which caused serious damage; the implementation of the EU directive on attacks against information systems and clarification of the savings provision for law enforcement agencies, according to the fact sheet put out by the government publishing service about the Serious Crime Act 2015. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Why did the Serious Crime Act of 2015 change the Computer Misuse Act?  </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              As according to this same government fact sheet concerning the Serious Crime Act's discoveries about the changing world of computer misuse, the government outlined that it was essential that “The right framework of offences is in place and that there is clarity in how the powers that are are used to investigate cybercrime interact with the offences designed to catch cyber criminals.” 
              <br><br>
              This highlights the inability for the Computer Misuse Act as it was defined to prosecute the changing world of cybercrime, as well as the necessity for the Computer Misuse Act to be amended so that it could be better used to prosecute and tackle the developing world of Computer Misuse offenders. It also brings up the major issue with having such an ill-defined and ill-suited piece of legislation such as the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 being used to help with very current issues; the fact that without proper legislative backing, these investigations cannot take place and offenders cannot be brought to justice whilst more damage is caused. 
              <br><br>
              The catalyst for these changes from the Serious Crime Act of 2015 was a National Security Strategy investigation that identified that hostile attacks on the UK cyberspace by other states and large scale cybercrime were a 'tier one' threat to national security in 2010. In response to this, the National Cyber Security Programme (or NCSP) was set up to help meet the objectives of the strategy which was given a budget of £860 million by the UK government; of which around 1o% has been invested into building law enforcement capabilities to tackle cybercrime. 
              <br><br>
              This is all outlined by the government in their fact sheet on the issue which emphasises the clarity necessary in the powers used to investigate cybercrime, which meant change to the Act was a requirement. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h1>Problems with utilising the Computer Misuse Act </h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Fundamental issues  </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              The main, fundamental issue with the act that has repeatedly emerged during the course of this research into its history and utility is the knowledge gap. As also described by an article by Peter Yapp for the Society for Computers and Law, the main problem is that Judges and prosecutors have little understanding of the real issues when it comes to cybercrime. This has meant that the Computer Misuse Act has not been working for cyber security practitioners, but also means that it has not been working for the law enforcement officers and the Crown Prosecution Service either. 
              <br><br>
              The solution to this major flaw would have to be the involvement of experts in the Cyber security industry in the formation of legislation and legal framework that governs how they operate. 
              <br><br>
              The second biggest issue is simply the fluid state of the digital industry and therefore the constantly changing nature of the threats due to the rapidly evolving nature of technology in general. Crime statistics from the Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year ending in September 2019, also referenced by P. Yapp, showed that the biggest growth area reported to Action Fraud was in hacking for extortion. The figures illustrated that this had nearly doubled from 2,147 to 4,133 over just one year. 
              <br><br>
              I myself have recently seen the effects of this rapidly changing industry, full of threats as public exams in my school must now be undertaken without wearing a watch, due to the increasing influence and reach of 'smart wearable tech.' Whilst we cannot expect this growth to slow down any time soon and cannot enforce any sort of legislation to do so, a more frequent and meaningful connection between prosecutors, legislators and cyber security professionals could help to mitigate this known problem. 
              <br><br>
              One of the other, but certainly not last, problems with the Act is the lack of scope within its vague boundaries for protection for those hacking for legitimate purposes, such as those conducting justified hacking for cyber threat intelligence research and investigation. The main problem being the blanket 'unauthorised access' term, which would criminalise investigations for threat intelligence which require, as the SCL describe, the scanning, interrogation and light touch interaction with both compromised victims' and criminals' systems. 
              <br><br>
              This has led to a bottlenecking of UK based vulnerability scanning companies, as the US has greater protection from prosecution for this from their act. The US's own Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which as Thomson Reuters assert, is a federal criminal law making it unlawful for unauthorised access of a computer to obtain information from specifically, government or protected individuals' machines. 
              <br><br>
              This act has some better protection from the main flaws of our own UK act, with specific instances and machines being defined, in order to better protect legitimate users and to be able to properly prosecute real criminals. The act was even originally passed, as the National Association of Criminal Defence lawyers state, four years before our own in 1986, due to the belief that protection against computer crime may need to be implemented. 
              <br><br>
              However, the prosecution of this area of crime is very difficult, and as the NACDL goes on to say, it has also had to be amended many times, and fails to define the unauthorised nature of access. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Professional and Public opinion </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              According to some analysis by the HM Courts and Tribunals Service in 2019 as stated by politics.co.uk, there were 441 prosecutions under the act between 2007 and 2018, and whilst nearly 90% of these prosecutions ended in convictions, out of the 45 convictions in 2018, only nine resulted in actual prison sentences. It was also equally likely in this year for offenders under the act to be given an official caution, rather than face prosecution. 
              <br><br>
              Computer Weekly reported in 2021 that the Home Secretary Priti Patel will explore reform for the Computer Misuse Act, and outlined plans to launch a consultation for information gathering after a report from the Criminal Law Reform Now Network (CLRNN) called on the government to review and make changes to the law. 
              <br><br>
              In this report by the CLRNN it outlines that the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 has not kept pace with the change of technology during its thirty years of existence. They call for the government to make changes to the Act and outline problems and present recommendations for how to reform it, with endorsement from industry professionals to back up their claims. 
              <br><br>
              The problems that the CLRNN brought up to the government in their 2020 report include: the frequency and growing number of computer misuse crimes, with an estimated 1,121,000 incidents of computer misuse in the year to June 2018 and 977,000 from the year to June 2019 reported by the CSEW; A vanishingly low conviction rate for these crimes despite the aforementioned figure of only 2% resulting in investigation and a miniscule fraction of 1% actually resulting in prosecution or conviction; the confusing legal framework of the Computer Misuse Act and how the 'outdated' and 'ambiguous' terminology mean that application of the legislation is difficult; and finally, the breadth of the offences under the act which criminalise acts which would be considered non-culpable, such as cyber threat intelligence or academic research. 
              <br><br>
              The report also included suggestions for how to reform the act in order to solve these issues, including better measures and clarification on how to prosecute under the act as well as defences for cyber threat professionals and other legitimate users who could be caught in the crossfire of the act, and building consistency with the much needed Data Protection Act of 2018. The Report also called for better guidance in how to prosecute and sentence crimes under the act, and for a better legal framework in the Computer Misuse Act more in tune with the modern world. 
              <br><br>
              Overall, these suggestions would better equip both cyber security professionals and the criminal prosecutors of computer misuse cases to better protect both the public and corporations from cases of definite criminal action involving computer systems, data and information. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <h3>Conclusion  </h3>
            <br>
            <p id="article-text">
              After studying several of the high-profile and fringe cases which have utilised the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 in its many edited and updated forms, reading legal experts' and other journalists' opinions on the matter; I have concluded that the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 definitively needs to be updated to better reflect the changing digital climate of today. 
              <br><br>
              This change should involve the communication of the cyber security industry and those who legislate crime in order to better tailor the law to those who are affected by it. Better connections between experts in these fields would mean that definitions and criminalisation within laws like the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 could be reformed to become more accurate, as well as more useful, for the prosecution of cybercrime. 
              <br><br>
              The act remains as outdated as it was when it first passed into legislature, which as my thesis statement indicates, is hypocritical from its original intended purpose. By its very nature, the definition of cybercrime is always changing in step with our hastily developing world, and so, I believe, should our legal system in order to effectively deal with it. 
              <br><br>
              Therefore, the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 is hypocritical from its design, because it fails to prosecute the exact crimes that it set out to criminalise, and has fallen at several hurdles since its creation. Law should change in order to keep pace with the evolving threats of the developing digital landscape, and this act is not fit for purpose. 
              <br><br>
              The Computer Misuse Act of 1990 is an anachronism. The technology it had in mind has long been forgotten about. It is time for change and for reform.
